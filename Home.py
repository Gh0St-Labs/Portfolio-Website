# If a folder named 'pages', just like this one, is created in a Project, and the python files inside which have
# streamlit loaded inside them will appear on the Browser with the Mother File (which should be outside the
# pages directory). It will appear as an Seperate page with the Mother file. This methodology can be used to add
# contact pages in our website.
# The syntax is mentioned below. Pandas can use list indexing / slicing, I don't know you name it.
# The [10:4] one.
